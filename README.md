# Drug Consumption Regression

This project explores the relationship between personality traits and drug consumption behaviors using the Drug Consumption (Quantified) dataset. The dataset contains personality measures based on the NEO-FFI-R model, impulsivity, sensation seeking, and demographic attributes for 1,885 respondents. Machine learning classification techniques are applied to predict an individualâ€™s likelihood of drug use from these features. Results indicate that specific personality dimensions, particularly openness and impulsivity, are significant predictors of substance use behavior. The findings highlight the potential of data-driven models to identify psychological and social factors influencing drug consumption patterns.
