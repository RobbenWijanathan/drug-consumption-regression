# Drug Consumption Analysis

This project analyzes drug consumption patterns using a multivariate dataset containing demographic, personality, and behavioural attributes. The study includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, visualization, and predictive modelling in R. The goal is to identify key factors associated with drug usage and evaluate model performance.

The results show behavioural trends across demographic groups and significant correlations between personality traits and substance use.
